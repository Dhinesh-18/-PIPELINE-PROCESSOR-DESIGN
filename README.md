DOMAIN: VLSI

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH

This project involves designing a 4-stage pipelined processor that supports basic instructions, including:

ADD (Addition) SUB (Subtraction) LOAD (Memory Load Operation)

The processor is implemented using Verilog/VHDL and follows a 4-stage pipeline design:

Fetch (IF) – Instruction fetching from memory. Decode (ID) – Instruction decoding and operand fetching. Execute (EX) – ALU operation execution. Write-back (WB) – Writing results back to registers/memory.

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:

Design a 4-stage pipelined processor in Verilog/VHDL. Implement data forwarding and hazard detection if required. Simulate and verify each pipeline stage.

DELIVERABLES:

✅ Processor Verilog/VHDL Code ✅ Testbench for Functional Verification ✅ Simulation Showing Each Pipeline Stage
